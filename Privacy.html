  <h1>Privacy Policy for AI Card Cutter</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    AI Card Cutter is a Chrome extension that helps debaters format evidence into judge-ready debate cards.
    We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how your data is handled.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    This extension processes <em>only</em> the text that you highlight on webpages to generate debate cards.
    The extension does not collect or transmit personally identifiable information, browsing history, or other sensitive data.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User-highlighted text is processed locally in your browser to create formatted cards.</li>
    <li>Optional preferences (e.g., citation style or tag length) may be stored locally using Chromeâ€™s <code>storage</code> API.</li>
    <li>No data is sold, transferred, or shared with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    AI Card Cutter does not share your data with any external parties. All processing occurs locally in the browser.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The extension requests limited Chrome permissions (<code>activeTab</code>, <code>contextMenus</code>,
    <code>storage</code>, <code>scripting</code>, and <code>downloads</code>) strictly to enable its single purpose:
    cutting and exporting debate cards. No extra permissions are requested or used.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are made, the updated policy will be included
    with the extension package and linked in the Chrome Web Store listing.
